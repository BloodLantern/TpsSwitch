# Jotaro's Bizarre Run

## Description

This game is about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 3rd part's first character: Jotaro Kujo and his stand Star Platinum.
<br/>
The goal is to reach the end of the level by jumping over walls, activating mechanisms and cooperating with your partner.
<br/>
This is a 2-player cooperative game with a third-person view, where one player controls Jotaro while the other is controlling Star Platinum.

## Gameplay

Each player is assigned a color: Blue or Red. They can interact with objects of their color.
<br/>
- The player who controls Jotaro can move horizontally and jump to avoid obstacles. Jotaro also continuously moves forward.
- The other one controls Star Platinum and can aim then shoot bullets at objects to interact or destroy them. He can also make both players swap roles: the one controlling Jotaro now controls Star Platinum and vice-versa. Each player controls a new character but they keep their initial color.

## What we learned

We learned to use Unreal Engine 5 with the Nintendo Switch and to integrate our C++ code further into our game. The majority of the game code was made (or remade) in C++ which is way better than the previous projects!

## Tools/Platforms

- Unreal Engine 5.2
- Visual Studio Community 2022
